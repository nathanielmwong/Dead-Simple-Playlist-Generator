# Dead Simple Playlist Generator
 Batch playlist generation for windows
Current updates to Windows Media Player have completely forgotten how to play from a directory through the UI, particularly if you have OSTs with multiple artists that tries to assign a new album per artist...
So in parsing directories the same way normal users evaluate albums, this program points recursively at a music collection, and a playlist folder.
It's not pretty, but it's a hell of a lot faster than Microsoft combing through every file on your entire network to load an album incorrectly.
